# Hypothesis and Research Questions

>#### *“How has airline travel in Australia changed over the years?”*

##For these questions filter column B IN/OUT = O (Outbound)

- [x] What are the top 10 most travelled destinations by Australians?

*Simply sum up the numbers for all destinations and use a bar/pie chart to visualise.*

- [Julian] What city has the most Australians travelling overseas?

*Same as above, can also use a map with color to visualise.*

- [Rahul] What are the top 5 most used airlines by Australians travelling overseas?

*Same as above, pie chart is probably better for market share.*

- [Rahul] How has prices of airline seats (Economy and Business Class) changed over the years? Is there an correlation between price and time of travel? (Will have to use a formula to covert CPI into actually monetary values)

*Can use line chart to present. Also we can compare the price change of different airlines.*


##For these questions filter column B IN/OUT = I (Inbound)

- [Julian] What Australian city has the most number of international travellers visiting?

- [Rahul] What are the top 5 most used airlines by International travellers to get to Australia?

- [Rahul] What is the most common route taken by international travellers to get to Australia?

*Can use map to visualise.*

- [Cancel for the moment] What are the top 10 countries that have the most international travellers to Australia?


##Set column B IN/OUT to use both I and O

- [Julian] How are the flights related to seasons/holidays?

*May need to calculate correlation through Python.*

- [Julian] What month has typically the most amount of travellers? And which has the least?


##Using the Departures and Arrivals CSV

- [Rahul] How has arrivals and departures changed over the years? What could be a reason for such changes?

*Display this on a line graph with one line representing Departures and one representing Arrivals. Then create a separate graph of the Australian dollar. You can then summarize that more Australians travel overseas when AUS dollar is stronger.*

##Combine the data from Inbound and Outbound

- [Rahul] What is the ratio between inbound flights and outbound flights? How is it realted to time, airlines, and locations?

*May use area charrts.*
